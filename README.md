# Die Rolling Simulated Experiment

This algorithm simulates an experiment 10,000 times, where a die is continually rolled until two consecutive rolls add up to 7.

The "set.seed(1)" is a random number generator intended to allow the user to reproduce the results of the experiment, but can be removed to obtain a different result.

The result of this experiment provides the expected value (E(X)), where X is the number of rolls needed to achieve the sum of 7 from two consecutive rolls.

The output of this algorithm is 7.0184.
